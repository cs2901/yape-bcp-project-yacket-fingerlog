# Introduction
Since the evolution of the internet and the creation of smart phones, mobile applications have become increasingly necessary to facilitate us in our daily lives. In banking issues this facility is not alien, since the way to transfer money has changed radically. One of the applications that most sound and have changed the way we do transactions is Yape, this is an application for smarthphones launched by the BCP that facilitates the transfer of money.
 In the course of Software Engineering a professional environment has been recreated with real costumers, in this case Yape is the costumer to whom we have to advise so that the number of users that he has increases rapidly, for which he will have to present an idea for then validate it and, followed by the metrics taught in the course, implement them. In the present report, Yacket will be presented which will add the feature of issuing an electronic invoice to the Yape application, in this way we intend to increase the amount of Yaperos.
For this, two potential costumers have been defined. The first one is the yape costumer that usually goes to mypes and pymes. The second is a possible owner and owner of the mypes and pymes. Both like technology and constantly seek new ways to digitize the entire sales process, taking advantage of these tools that speed up, ensure and facilitate buying and selling.
The purpose of this project will be to implement the functionality of electronic tickets and invoices through Yape.
