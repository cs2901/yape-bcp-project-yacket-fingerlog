**Roles:** _owner, seller, customer_

## Must Have

1. As an owner, I can have my payment vouchers in my email, so that let me declare them to SUNAT easier.
2. As an owner, I can add/remove sellers for my business, so that let me assign more than one person to receive payments.
3. As a seller, I can generate payment vouchers faster, so that allows me to serve more clients.
4. As a seller, I can have my business and personal accounts isolated, so that won't confuse me.
5. As a seller, I can choose between the business that I have been added or a business that I own. 
6. As a customer, I can have my payment vouchers in my email, so I don't have to keep the physical voucher to change or return the product.
7. As a customer, I can pay without adding the business number to my contacts.

## Nice to Have
1. As an owner, I can have all my payment vouchers compiled in the app, so I don't have to search them manually.
2. As a seller, I can avoid typing all the items every time I'm selling them.
3. As a customer, I can see the detailed info about all the business where I have purchased some product.
4. As a customer, I can see the detailed info about my tickets.
5. 

## Out of Scope
1. As an owner, I can see a report of my sellings in the app.
2. As a seller, I can scan the barcode of the products, so that let me charge them faster.
3. As a customer, I can rate my payment experience in every business where I purchase a product.
